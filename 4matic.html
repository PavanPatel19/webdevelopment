        <h3 class="header">Performance on a par with sports cars.</h3>
        <p class="para">Hot on the heels of the world premiere of the new Mercedes Benz E-Class, its first high-performance variant is on the way from Mercedes-AMG. The E 43 4MATIC with the 3.0-litre V6 biturbo engine on board will represent the most powerful variant of the executive saloon when it is introduced in September 2016. With two new turbochargers and corresponding software applications, the supercharged six-cylinder engine delivers an output of 295 kW (401 hp). The ample peak torque of 520 Newton metres is available right from a low engine speed of 2,500 rpm.</p>

<div class="info1">

<img class="pic1" src="gallery/4MATIC-2.jpg">
<h3 class="header1">Sporty and distinctive appearance.</h3>
 <p class="para1">The looks of the E 43 4MATIC also render it immediately recognisable as a member of the AMG family. Apart from underscoring the powerful and self-assured appearance, three large openings in the front apron also ensure an optimum flow of air to the coolers. Two elegant cross fins on the outer cooling openings enhance the vehicle’s visual presence. The diamond grille with chromed pins, a louvre in high-gloss black and the AMG lettering represent further hallmarks of the AMG 43 models.</p>

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/4MATIC-3.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">Dynamic calibre: the interior design.</h3>
        <p class="para">The V6 biturbo engine boasts a high power output combined with low fuel consumption and emissions. The high power output of 295 kW (401 hp) is attributable, among other things, to new, larger turbochargers and the higher charge-air pressure of 1.1 bar. Installed close to the engine, the two turbochargers are especially spontaneous in their response. The NANOSLIDE® coating on the cylinder liners has also undergone further development in the Formula 1 V6 hybrid turbo engines from Mercedes-Benz. Especially tough and, therefore, wear-resistant, this coating also reduces friction, thereby contributing to higher efficiency.</p>

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/4MATIC-4.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">High on power, low on consumption.</h3>
        <p class="para">The interior reinforces the dynamic calibre of the new E 43 4MATIC with numerous individual details. The driver and front passenger find a secure position in the sports seats even when driving at speed, thanks to the improved lateral support. The upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre in black (optionally: nappa leather) features a distinctive layout and red topstitching. To match the seat design, the door centre panels and the dashboard are finished in ARTICO man-made leather with red topstitching. Exclusive pedals, a black roof lining and red seat belts add further sporty highlights. The multifunction sports steering wheel in black nappa leather with red contrasting topstitching and featuring a flattened bottom section is ideally suited to an emphatic driving style.</p>

<div class="info1">

<img class="pic1" src="gallery/4MATIC-5.jpg">
<h3 class="header1">Short shift times, high efficiency.</h3>
 <p class="para1">The 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission is specially matched to the requirements of the new E 43 4MATIC. The AMG developers have managed to reduce the shift times of the 9-speed transmission by means of a dedicated software application. The multiple downshift function enables more spontaneous short bursts of speed, while the double-declutching function in “Sport” and “Sport Plus” transmission modes makes for an even more emotional driving experience. Defined ignition intervention additionally enables faster gear shifting than in “Eco” and “Comfort” modes. “Manual” mode can be selected using a separate button in the centre console. The gear changes are based on the selected transmission mode and the driver can now change gear using the paddles on the steering wheel. Moreover, the transmission stays in the selected gear and does not automatically shift up when the engine speed reaches the limit.</p>

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/4MATIC-6.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">More agility: the sports suspension.</h3>
        <p class="para">For added agility, more neutral cornering behaviour and higher traction even when driving at speed, the developers in Affalterbach have designed a dedicated sports suspension on the basis of the AIR BODY CONTROL multi-chamber air suspension system. The Adaptive Damping System also features in a model-specific configuration and offers a choice of three modes – “Comfort”, “Sport” and “Sport Plus”. This provides for broader scope between a high level of comfort for longer journeys and sporty driving dynamics. The four-link front axle is fitted with special steering knuckles and load-bearing joints; all components have been optimised in terms of rigidity.

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/4MATIC-7.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">Rear-biased and agile.</h3>
        <p class="para">The standard-specification AMG Performance 4MATIC four-wheel drive features rear-biased torque distribution with a front/rear axle split of 31 to 69 percent. This configuration provides for enhanced driving dynamics and higher lateral acceleration on the road as well as improved traction when accelerating. In combining the permanent four-wheel drive with the 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission, the developers have opted for a change of concept: the single-stage transfer case of the four-wheel drive is flange-mounted on the 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission as a separate system. On earlier generations of vehicles, the transfer case was integrated into the 7G-TRONIC PLUS.

<div class="info1">

<img class="pic1" src="gallery/4MATIC-8.jpg">
<h3 class="header1">Characteristics at the tap of a finger.</h3>
 <p class="para1">With the five DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes “Eco”, “Comfort”, “Sport”, “Sport Plus” and “Individual”, the driver can tailor the characteristics of the E 43 4MATIC to suit individual preferences at the tap of a finger. The available range extends from efficient and comfortable to extremely sporty. This modifies key parameters, such as the response of the engine, transmission, suspension and steering. Independently of the DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes, the driver has the option of pressing the “M” button to switch directly to manual mode, in which gearshifts are executed exclusively using the shift paddles on the steering wheel. The suspension set-ups can also be selected as necessary. The DYNAMIC SELECT “Sport” and “Sport Plus” transmission modes are configured with a clear emphasis on driving dynamics in the new E 43 4MATIC. This results from an agile accelerator pedal characteristic with direct set-up and emotional gear shifting with reduced shift times, double declutching and deactivation of certain cylinders. The increased idling speed additionally enables the vehicle to move off quickly and provides for faster acceleration from a standing start.</p>

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/4MATIC-9.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">Speed-sensitive sports steering.</h3>
        <p class="para">The speed-sensitive sports steering features a variable ratio in the E 43 4MATIC. It stands out with its precise, highly authentic feedback. Steering power assistance is available in a choice of two modes – “Comfort” or “Sport”. The relevant characteristics are automatically activated depending on the selected DYNAMIC SELECT transmission mode or can be personalised in Individual mode. Manual torque is increased in “Sport” mode, providing more feedback on driving conditions.
