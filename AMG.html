        <h3 class="header1">Success Story: The Mercedes-AMG GT.</h3>
        <p class="para1">Mr. Moers, Mercedes-AMG entered a new market segment with the Mercedes-AMG GT. Would you already speak of a success story?<br>Yes, absolutely. We were really thrilled by the sensational success of the Mercedes-AMG GT in the German market. A new sports car has to rigorously earn its merits. But today we aren’t only where we wanted to be with the AMG GT – we’re already much further along. Although that’s not a phenomenon limited to the German market. The GT was well received in other markets too.</p>

 <h3 class="title">Debut in Goodwood: Mercedes-AMG GT R.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph">In June, the Mercedes-AMG GT R—currently the most powerful production version of the GT—celebrated its debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, with Lewis Hamilton taking the first laps. What can AMG aficionados expect from this car?<br>
The GT R is the athletic flagship model of the GT family, inspired directly by racing. Compared to the GT S, not only is the engine of the GT R completely retuned and noticeably more powerful, we also have active aerodynamic features on the front.</p>

 <p class="paragraph">A radiator shutter in the new Panamericana grille controls the balance between low air resistance and maximum ventilation of the engine compartment. The active aerodynamic profile—an variably downward movable underbody panelling—delivers tremendous surface pressure in conjunction with the rear wing. The suspension benefits from the active rear-axle steering – and then there are the numerous lightweight components such as the carbon front wings, front and rear aprons made of carbon fiber.

<h3 class="header1">Innovative rear-axle steering.</h3>
 <p class="para1">With the active rear-axle steering you’ve assembled a very innovative technology package. What does it mean for the GT R driver?<br>
We’ve put a lot of time and care into the active rear-axle steering. In tight corners the manoeuvrability and responsiveness of the GT R are drastically increased through the rear axle steering against the front wheels by a few degrees. By contrast, in fast corners or high-speed manoeuvers, the rear axle steers ever so slightly with the front wheels, thus ensuring an incredible level of stability. With this technology in the AMG GT R, you can take the most exacting stretches on the Nürburgring Nordschleife noticeably faster than without active rear-axle steering.</p>

 <h3 class="title">Debut in Goodwood: Mercedes-AMG GT R.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph">And what’s the story behind the name “Green Hell magno” for the paint color?<br>
The GT R was developed on the Nürburgring, “The Green Hell”. It was here that the GT3 racing version enjoyed great success in endurance racing. The Green Hell is also the natural habitat for the GT R. And when you’re driving on the Nordschleife, new impressions, new challenges, new discoveries emerge at every turn, even for experienced drivers..</p>

 <p class="paragraph">The Green Hell is a relentless teacher. It doesn’t let you off the hook. It doesn’t give you a breather. That is also precisely the spirit in which we developed the AMG GT R: To always become better, to never sit back, to accept and overcome challenges. Then this gorgeous, semi-gloss coating emerged in a rather casual green. The rest is history.</p>

<h3 class="header">Driving Performance 24/7.</h3>
 <p class="para">You have shaped AMG very strongly over the past 20 years. Does the opposite also apply?<br>
I think that’s perfectly logical. To work here and to be able to help write the history of this brand I feel is a privilege. We live Driving Performance 24/7 and we do it wholeheartedly. Elsewhere that might be an empty slogan – not for us at AMG. And it’s certainly not an empty slogan for me.</p>

 <h3 class="title">Life runs to AMG's beat.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph">Has the CEO position changed Tobias Moers the man?<br>
My way of life hasn’t really changed. We’ve certainly rebuilt the brand, increased our sales performance, created new products, redefined the Performance Center – in that sense, my working life has become more complex, although I still hang out on a test track twice a month. As CEO, I find myself in the tremendous position of not only developing the products themselves but also the Mercedes-AMG brand and the company Mercedes-AMG GmbH.</p>

 <p class="paragraph">Are there actually moments in which you slow down?<br>
Fast cars also have to have good  brakes, right? My life’s rhythm, my  work ethos, my weekends – all of that  runs to AMG’s beat. Yet I deal with that  in a very reflective way and have never  felt it to be a burden. I couldn’t main tain this pace if I had no real joy in my profession. But I want to tell you a little something: AMG is still only the second  most important thing in my life.</p>
