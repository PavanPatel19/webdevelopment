        <h3 class="header1">Pullman Guard: Highly effective protected space.</h3>
        <p class="para1">The interaction between all the components provides the occupants with a highly effective protected space which not only includes ballistic protection but also comprehensive protection against explosive devices. With its sophisticated and strong protective system, the new S 600 Pullman Guard has met all the personal protection requirements of the relevant authorities in Germany and is comprehensively certified in accordance with resistance class VR9.</p>
        
        <p class="para1">Already at the body shell stage, protective components of special steel are integrated into the cavities between the body structure and the outer skin. Special aramid and PE components provide additional splinter protection. Intelligent overlapping systems at particularly critical points provide comprehensive ballistic protection.</p>

 <h3 class="title1">Exclusivity at its highest level.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph1">Many governments, heads of state and royal families around the world have for decades chosen Mercedes-Benz saloon cars with the designation “Pullman” to travel in the stately style befitting their status. “Besides providing spacious seating in first-class comfort for high-ranking passengers, the Mercedes-Maybach Pullman is of course the embodiment of exclusivity at its highest level,” said Ola Källenius, Member of the Daimler AG Management Board and responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales and Marketing. “One can sense the significance and greatness of it in every detail.”</p>

 <p class="paragraph1">The twin-turbo V-12 engine in the Mercedes-Maybach Pullman has an output of 390 kW (530 hp). It has a displacement of 5,980 ccm, and produces a peak torque of 830 Nm from 1,900 rpm. The top speed of the Pullman Guard is electronically limited to 160 km/h.
The first customers will receive their Mercedes-Maybach Pullman, which of course can once again be highly customised, in September 2016. The first Guard versions will be delivered in the second half of 2017.</p>
