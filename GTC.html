        <h3 class="header">A more intense result.</h3>
        <p class="para">
            Shortly after the world premiere of the AMG GT R, the sports car and performance brand from Affalterbach is presenting two exciting roadster variants of the two-seater sports car. Alongside the AMG GT Roadster, the AMG GT C Roadster enhances the portfolio with a completely new model variant. “With our two Roadster models, we are strategically expanding the AMG GT family by two exciting variants. With the AMG GT C Roadster, we are also introducing a new model variant to which we have transferred main performance-related components from our top sports car, the AMG GT R. The result: a highly dynamic driving experience in a very exclusive ambience, coupled with that pure roadster feeling,” says Tobias Moers, Chairman of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.<br>
 
 
Mercedes-AMG GT R:
Fuel consumption combined: 11.4 l/100 km;
combined CO₂ emissions: 259 g/km.*

 <h3 class="title">More is more.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph">The AMG GT C Roadster not only delivers more output and torque, it also impresses with numerous technical highlights from the Mercedes-AMG GT R for even more dynamic performance. Both Roadsters are quickly transformed from coupés to open-top sports cars.</p>

 <p class="paragraph">The fabric roof opens and closes in around eleven seconds, and can do this at speeds of up to 50 km/h. Three soft top colours can be chosen to suit the eleven exterior and ten interior colours.</p>

<img class="pic1" src="gallery/GTC-2.jpg">
<h3 class="header1">New stage: peak power.</h3>
 <p class="para1">With the AMG GT C Roadster, Mercedes-AMG is introducing a further output level of the 4.0-litre V8 biturbo, thereby underlining the exclusive character of the new model. At 410 kW (557 hp), the peak output is 35 kW (47 hp) above that of the AMG GT S and 20 kW (28 hp) below the Mercedes-AMG GT R. The maximum torque of 680 newton metres is available from 1900 to 5750 rpm. A sprint from zero to 100 km/h is absolved in 3.7 seconds, and this fulminating acceleration only ends at the top speed of 316 km/h.<br>
 
 
Mercedes-AMG GT S:
Fuel consumption combined: 9.6-9.4 l/100 km;
combined CO₂ emissions: 224-219 g/km.*</p>

        <h3 class="header">Spontaneous agility.</h3>
        <p class="para">The eight-cylinder engine thrills with its immediate response, a linear, finely controllable power delivery and powerful acceleration in all rpm ranges. Also the seven-speed dual clutch transmission in a transaxle arrangement at the rear axle arises a new power level of the Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster by modifying the hardware and software. The first gear of the AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7-speed sport transmission has a higher ratio, while seventh gear and the final drive have a lower ratio. This makes for even more agile acceleration and very fast responses to sudden accelerator movements.</p>

 <h3 class="title">Pure Sound, maximum ride.</h3>
 <p class="paragraph">The AMG GT C Roadster is equipped with the AMG Performance exhaust system as standard to obtain an even more emotive sound experience. Two variably adjustable flaps modulate the exhaust note of the Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadsters authentically and directly. The two AMG Roadster variants have adopted a special technical highlight from the AMG GT R: the active air management system. Vertical louvres located in the lower area of the front apron can be opened and closed by an electric motor in around one second. This ensures that the cooling performance is according to need.</p>

 <p class="paragraph">The AMG sports suspension likewise confirms the motor racing heritage of the new AMG Roadsters. Wishbones, steering knuckles and hub carriers on the front and rear axle are manufactured entirely out of forged aluminium to reduce the unsprung masses. The wheels are also guided by double wishbones. The resulting precision in camber and track allows high cornering speeds and gives the driver optimum, highly precise road feedback right up to the very high cornering limits.</p>

<div class="info"> 
        <img class="pic" src="gallery/GTC-4.jpg">
        <h3 class="header">Powerful and expressive design.</h3>
        <p class="para">From the expressive AMG Panamericana grille to the long, muscular bonnet and the wide rear end, the two-seater guarantees a pure sports car experience even when stationary. The rear end also features numerous, conspicuous innovations. The new aluminium side walls of the AMG GT C Roadster widen the open-top two-seater by 57 millimetres compared to the AMG GT Roadster.
Also the interior design echoes the design lines of the exterior. The dashboard places an extreme emphasis on width, creating an impression of a powerful wing. The high beltlines, concave door panels, dynamically rising centre console and low seat position perfectly integrate the driver into the cockpit. The new, light-coloured interior in macchiato beige Exclusive nappa STYLE leather is available for the first time, lending the AMG Roadster even more individuality and exclusivity.</p>
